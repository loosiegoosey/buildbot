c = BuildmasterConfig = {}

c['workers'] = [worker.Worker("example-worker", "pass")]

c['builders'] = [
    util.BuilderConfig(name="runtests",
      workernames=["example-worker"],
      factory=util.BuildFactory([
          steps.Git(repourl='git://github.com/example/repo.git', mode='incremental'),
          steps.ShellCommand(command=["make", "test"])
      ]))
]

c['schedulers'] = [schedulers.SingleBranchScheduler(
                        name="all",
                        change_filter=util.ChangeFilter(branch="main"),
                        treeStableTimer=None,
                        builderNames=["runtests"])]
